## Data included in the assessment

## Changes {auto-animate="true"}

::: incremental
- Landings
    - Landings from Oregon Coast INPFC area were included.
    - Landings from 1977--1982 in the reporting area that includes both U.S.
      and Canadian waters were assigned 50--50\% to each country rather than
      100\% to the U.S., as was done previously.
    - Bycatch from the at-sea Pacific Hake fishery was included.
    - Fixed-gear and trawl landings from 2021--2022 were included.
:::

## Changes {auto-animate="true"}

::: incremental
- West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey data were updated and extended
  through 2022.
    - Relative index of abundance,
    - length composition, and
    - conditional-age-at-length data. 
:::

## Changes {auto-animate="true"}

::: incremental
- The environmental index data were updated and extended through 2022.
:::

## Changes {auto-animate="true"}

::: incremental
- West Coast Observers Program
    - Mean weights and length compositions from discarded fish observed by 
      the West Coast Observers Program were updated and the new values for 2020
      and 2021 were added to the model.
    - Discard rates from 2020--2021 were added to the model.
