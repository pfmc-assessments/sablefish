# To Do

* push code that writes catch file to data-processed
* write index data to a file bc right now it is just copy and pasted
* rerun sdmTMB to get north south instead of state stratification
* document that 2021 used season 1 for wcgbts index

## Bridging

* rename the fleets
* check that at-sea hake fishery bycatch are the correct values, emailed VT on
  2023-07-07
* update environmental index cv because the DFA analysis no longer works and
  Nick is using a Bayesian approach that now gives confidence intervals rather
  than an estimate of the uncertainty
* clean up som unused blocks
* re-weight the model

## Sensitivities

### Good Ideas

### Not So Good Ideas

* input commercial fishery lengths even though they are not typically used
  because there are no age data given that the ages have not been read.
* might need to run sdmTMB with only data up to 2021
