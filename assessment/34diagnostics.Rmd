## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

```{r render-model-jitter, results = "asis", eval = ifelse(file.exists(file.path(here::here(), model_location, "base_model-results-jitter.md")), TRUE, FALSE)}
sa4ss::read_child(file.path(here::here(), model_location, "base_model-results-jitter.md"))
```

The estimated measures of uncertainty for `r xfun::numbers_to_words(NROW(parameters_bad))` parameters were in the hundreds, if not thousands suggesting that they were poorly informed. We chose to leave their parameterization as is but we do show a sensitivity where all of these parameters were fixed at their estimated values to characterize changes the amount of uncertainty in derived quantities when they were not estimated compared to the base model where they were estimated (see Section \@ref(sensitivity-analyses) and Figure \@ref(fig:sensitivity-3-compare3-Bratio)).

### Retrospective Analysis

A retrospective analysis was conducted by running the base model with
data removed for the past `r n_retro` years (Table \@ref(tab:RetroMohnsrho)). All retrospective model runs fell within the uncertainty estimates from the base model. There was limited evidence of a retrospective pattern in estimates of spawning biomass (Figure \@ref(fig:RetroSsb)) and stock status (Figure \@ref(fig:RetroFractionunfished)). The retrospective pattern in stock status is largely driven by the relative amount of data available to inform the estimates of some of the largest recruitment events observed for `r spp`. The estimated likelihood components and select parameter estimates are shown in Table \@ref(tab:retro-ests).

### Historical Analysis

Estimates of the current current spawning biomass (Figure \ref{fig:historical-model-comparison-sb}) and fraction unfished (Figure \ref{fig:historical-model-comparison-unfished}) were consistent with prior stock assessments, particularly from the 1980s forward, the period of time with good data for `r spp`. Estimates of recent spawning biomass are greater for this update and the 2019 update compared to the three previous models, all of which estimate a lower spawning biomass than what is currently estimated due to the recent large recruitment events. The historical models, i.e., models ran prior the last benchmark assessment, differ from more recent models that use a larger age group for the maximum age in the data bins. The largest differences between the models with respect to estimates of fraction unfished occur in the 1960s and the 1980s, where this assessment aligns with recent models in the 1960s and older models in the 1980s, highlighting the uncertainty in the magnitude of the large recruitment event in the early 1960s. See Figure 83 in @haltuch_status_2019b for comparisons to older assessments of `r spp`, i.e., back to 2005.

### Likelihood Profiles

**to do**: this section is incomplete

Likelihood profiles were conducted for sex-specific $M$, steepness, $R_0$ and values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimated the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value. The priors for all parameters, including the parameter being profiled, were included in every likelihood model. For example, including the prior on $M$ across the profiled values of $M$ provides information on the likelihood contribution of that prior as if it were estimated in the model.  

The profile over female $M$ suggested the negative log-likelihood was minimized at estimate from the base model,
`r text_parameter(model, "NatM.+Fem", "%.2f")` (yr$^{-1}$; Figure \ref{fig:profile-female-natural-mortality-piner}). This minimization occurs at the crosshair of information present in the age versus recruitment data. Though, the differences in the negative log likelihood were less than two for a range of values between 0.06--0.09, similar to the 2019 benchmark assessment [@haltuch_status_2019b].
