### Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The \gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random grid design; covering the coastal waters between 55 m and 1,280 m in depth [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two `passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May and early October. Only two vessels were used in 2019 and three in 2013, with one of the three in 2019 unable to complete its pass due to a government shutdown. No survey occurred in 2020 due to \gls{covid}. The design incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to Canadian borders. Note that the Survey is not permitted to access the \glspl{cca} in Southern California.

`r Spp` are observed across the full range of depths (Figure \@ref(fig:data-survey-wcgbt-proportion-by-depth)) and latitudes (Figure \@ref(fig:data-survey-wcgbt-proportion-by-latitude)) sampled by the \gls{s-wcgbt}. Across most years, there are at least 400 annual positive tows of `r spp` (see Supplementary csv files for sample sizes). A coastwide relative index of abundance was estimated for `r spp` using the Species Distribution Modeling platform written in \gls{tmb} [sdmTMB; @Anderson:2022:SRP]. A delta model with a gamma error distribution was selected over the lognormal distribution based on the quantile-quantile plots (Figure \@ref(fig:qq)). This was the same error distribution selected by the 2019 benchmark and 2021 update assessments. The relative index of abundance for `r spp` decreased to the lowest levels between 2008 and 2010, begun to slowly increase between 2011 and 2019, and then sharply increased from 2021 to 2022 to the highest estimated for the time series (Figure \@ref(fig:data-survey-wcgbt-index)).

Length and age samples collected annually during the \gls{s-wcgbt} were processed using 2 cm length bins between 18 cm and 90 cm and age bins between 0 and 50 years. The length compositions were expanded to the tow level and strata level (see Supplementary csv files for strata specifications). The same stratification was used for their expansion as was used in the 2019 benchmark and 2021 update assessments. The age data were included as conditional-age-at-length data to better inform the internal estimation of growth than can be done using marginal age data. Input sample sizes for the conditional-age-at-length data were the annual number of fish sampled for both age and length.

The 2021 and 2022 length compositions for fish less than 30 cm indicate potentially multiple above average recruitments entering the population (Figure \@ref(fig:comp-lendat-7-0-1)). The 2021--2022 age data also indicate above average observations of fish from the 2021 and 2020 cohorts (Figure \@ref(fig:comp-gstagedat-bub-7-0-1)). Across all years, age-0 fish were observed more frequently during the second pass of the survey compared to the first pass, with age-0 fish generally measuring less than 30 cm (Figure \@ref(fig:data-survey-wcgbt-young-length-by-year)). The size of age-1 fish generally ranged between 30 cm and 45 cm, with sizes increasing from pass 1 to pass 2. The distribution of age-1 fish size observed in 2021 and 2022 was more variable compared to most other years. Additionally, the distribution of sizes in age-1 fish varied between 2021 and 2022, with age-1 fish being slightly smaller by pass in 2022 compared to 2021.
