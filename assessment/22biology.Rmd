## Biological Data

A number of biological parameters were estimated outside the 2019 assessment model
(weight-length relationship, the maturity schedule, and fecundity relationships). These
values are treated as fixed in that model and this assessment update, and therefore, uncertainty reported for the stock assessment results does not include any uncertainty associated with these quantities.
