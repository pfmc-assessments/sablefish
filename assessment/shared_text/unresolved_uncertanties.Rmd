This assessment update estimates very large recruitment events occurring near the end of the modeled period in 2020 and 2021. Anecdotal information from the fishery of high bycatch of small `r spp` starting in the summer of 2021 indicated that there was likely a strong cohort entering the population and this is supported by the data collected by the \gls{s-wcgbt} in both 2021 and 2022.  However, since these young fish have only been observed in two years by the \gls{s-wcgbt} there is more uncertainty around the strength of these year classes that will be resolved with future subsequent observations by the survey and the fishery.   

The data available for `r spp` off the U.S. West Coast are not informative with respect to absolute stock
size and productivity. This could be, in part, due to the largely one-way-trip nature of the historical
series (i.e., a slow and steady decline in spawning biomass) that has only recently stabilized and
increased, which can be consistent with a larger less productive stock, a smaller more productive
stock, or many combinations in between. While the historical catches provide some information
about the minimum stock size necessary to remove the catches from the population, there is limited information in the data regarding the upper limit of the stock size. The above factors are also confounded by movement of `r spp` between the region included in this assessment and regions to the north. Likelihood profiles, parameter estimates, and general model behavior illustrate that small changes in many parameters can result in different estimates of management reference points.
However, because leading model parameters, such as natural mortality, selectivity, and historical recruitments, are estimated within the stock assessment model, the uncertainty about these estimates remains large and typically overlapped among the investigated models. The uncertainty will remain until a more informative time-series, better quality demographic and biological information are accumulated, or a range-wide analysis is completed for `r spp`.

Uncertainty in the current ageing methods (both bias and imprecision), as well as relatively sparse
fishery sampling, result in age data that are potentially variable. Furthermore, because `r spp` grow rapidly, nearing asymptotic length in their first decade of life, length data is not particularly informative about historical patterns in recruitment. The patterns observed in historical `r spp` recruitment suggest that the stock trajectory (via shifts in recruitment strength) is closely linked to productivity regimes in the California Current. Studies of oceanographic drivers of `r spp` recruitment explain between 25 percent and just over 50 percent of the `r spp` recruitment variability, depending upon the oceanographic covariates evaluted. Uncertainty in future environmental conditions, changes in the timing, dynamics, and productivity of the California Current ecosystem via climate change or cycles similar to the historical period should be considered a significant source of uncertainty in all projections of stock status. The ongoing WCGBT Survey is a fairly precise relative index of abundance over a broad demographic component of the stock, but it does not survey the entire stock as `r spp` reside in waters deeper than 1,280 m, the survey limit, and to the north. Therefore, a portion of the stock is unobserved. This index has the potential to inform future stock assessments about the scale of the population relative to catches being removed, however such information will require contrast in
the observed survey trend.
