## Fishery-Independent Data

Multiple fishery-independent surveys are incorporated in the assessment of `r spp` off the U.S. West Coast. The biological data and relative indices of abundance from the \gls{s-tri}, \gls{s-aslope}, and \gls{s-nslope} were not re-evaluated for this assessment update.  See @haltuch_status_2019b and @Kapur:2021:SSA for details on these data and how the were processed for inclusion within this assessment.
