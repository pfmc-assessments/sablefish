## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Landings {#commercial-landings}

Historical commercial landings prior to 1980 (or 1986 for Oregon) remained unchanged from the 2019 benchmark assessment. Landings data were pulled from PacFIN (ADD DATE) and re-evaluated in this assessment update.  

@kelli.johnson-NOAA Add the details about landings data that were omitted in 2019 and 2021 here.


This assessment update also pulled bycatch of `r spp` by the at-sea Pacific hake fishery from the \gls{afsc} North Pacific Groundfish and Halibut Observer (NORPAC) database (ADD DATE). These data were not included in the landings data used in the 2019 benchmark and 2021 update assessments. Across most years the bycatch of `r spp` in the at-sea Pacific hake fishery is relatively low, particularly compared to the landings data from other groundfish sectors contained in PacFIN.  However, there have been select years where the bycatch of `r spp` in this fishery has been higher than average which seem to correspond to one or two year after strong recruitment events for `r spp` (e.g., bycatch of 153 mt and 116 mt in 2017 and 2018, respectively).  The bycatch of `r spp` in this fishery in 2022 of 304 mt was greater than any other year in the time series (1990-2022).  These data were added to the trawl fleet landings in the model and were included in the model bridging to better understand the impact of adding these removals to the model.  


### Commercial Discard Data

The \gls{wcgop} estimates of commercial discards and biological data from 2020 and 2021 were added to the assessment update model. The assessment update for `r spp` conducted in 2021 experienced challenges where 2019 discard data appeared to depart in the frequency of `r spp` being discarded and the size of discarded fish requiring the assessment update to add a new retention block for the trawl and fixed gear fleets for 2019 and 2020. Including the most recent \gls{wcgop} data in this assessment update allowed for these data to better inform the estimation of recent discarding practices which may be changing due to large recent recruitment events.

The discard rates by fleet are similar in 2020 and 2021 but are increased compared to the 2019 rates (Figures \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-rates-fixed) and \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-rates-trawl)). The mean body weight of discarded fish by the fixed gear fleet are similar in 2022 and 2021 to those observed in 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-wghts-fixed)). The mean body of discarded fish by the trawl fleet declined by year since 2019 with increased variability in the body weights of discarded fish in the final year of data (Figure \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-wghts-trawl)).
