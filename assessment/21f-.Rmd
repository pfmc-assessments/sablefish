### Commercial Discard Data

The \gls{wcgop} estimates of commercial discards and biological data from 2020 and 2021 were added to the assessment update model. The assessment update for `r spp` conducted in 2021 experienced challenges where 2019 discard data appeared to depart in the frequency of `r spp` being discarded and the size of discarded fish requiring the assessment update to add a new retention block for the trawl and fixed gear fleets for 2019 and 2020. Including the most recent \gls{wcgop} data in this assessment update allowed for these data to better inform the estimation of recent discarding practices which may be changing due to large recent recruitment events.

The discard rates by fleet are similar in 2020 and 2021 but are increased compared to the 2019 rates (Figures \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-rates-fixed) and \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-rates-trawl)). The mean body weight of discarded fish by the fixed gear fleet are similar in 2022 and 2021 to those observed in 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-wghts-fixed)). The mean body of discarded fish by the trawl fleet declined by year since 2019 with increased variability in the body weights of discarded fish in the final year of data (Figure \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-wghts-trawl)).
