## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Landings {#commercial-landings}

Historical commercial landings prior to 1970, 1986, and 1980 for Washington, Oregon, and California, respectively, remained unchanged from the 2019 benchmark assessment. Landings data were pulled from PacFIN (17 July 2023) and re-evaluated in this assessment update.  

Changes to recent landings from \gls{pacfin} include typical updates to historical data given standard updates to fish-ticket data that normally results in changes of just a few mt per year. Additional changes to the data were made because of two changes in the methods used to extract the data. First, landings from the `Oregon Coast' \glsentrylong{inpfc} area, i.e., between 42.000--46.267\textdegree N. latitude, are no longer excluded from the total landings. The landings occurred between 1980--2011 and sum to approximately 4,060 mt. Annual summaries are not possible given the confidentiality of the data. Second, landings from 1977--1982 in the catch reporting area that includes both U.S. and Canadian waters are now assigned 50--50\% to each country rather than 100\% to the U.S. Specific differences are not reported here given it is unclear if their sums are confidential. Both of these changes were approved by state representatives prior to their use in this assessment.

This assessment update also pulled bycatch of `r spp` by the At-Sea Pacific Hake fishery since 1990 from the \gls{afsc} \gls{norpac} database (27 July 2023). These data were not included in the landings data used in the 2019 benchmark and 2021 update assessments. Across most years the bycatch of `r spp` in the At-Sea Pacific Hake fishery is relatively low, particularly compared to the landings data from other groundfish sectors contained in \gls{pacfin}.  However, there have been select years where the bycatch of `r spp` in this fishery has been higher than average, which seem to correspond to one or two year after strong recruitment events for `r spp` (e.g., bycatch of 153 mt and 116 mt in 2017 and 2018, respectively).  The bycatch of `r spp` in this fishery in 2022 of 304 mt was greater than any other year in the time series (1990--2022).  These data were added to landings for the trawl fleet in the model and were included in the model bridging to better understand the impact of adding these removals to the model.  

### Commercial Discard Data

The \gls{wcgop} estimates of commercial discards and biological data from 2020 and 2021 were added to the assessment update model. The assessment update for `r spp` conducted in 2021 experienced challenges where 2019 discard data appeared to depart in the frequency of `r spp` being discarded and the size of discarded fish requiring the assessment update to add a new retention block for the trawl and fixed gear fleets for 2019 and 2020. Including the most recent \gls{wcgop} data in this assessment update allowed for these data to better inform the estimation of recent discarding practices which may be changing due to large recent recruitment events.

The discard rates in the trawl fleet are similar in 2020 and 2021 but are increased compared to the 2019 rates (Figure \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-rates-trawl)). The increased observed discard rate in the trawl fleet aligns with reports from the fishery of increased encounters with young small fish in recent years. The discard rates of the fixed gear fleet in 2020 and 2021 were similar or slightly greater than the observed 2019 rates but 2020 and 2021 had larger uncertainty (Figures \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-rates-fixed)). The discard rate data were assumed to be normally distributed and fit by year in the model.

The mean body weight of discarded fish by the fixed gear fleet are similar in 2022 and 2021 to those observed in 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-wghts-fixed)). The mean body of discarded fish by the trawl fleet declined by year since 2019 with increased variability in the body weights of discarded fish in the final year of data (Figure \@ref(fig:data-wcgop-discard-wghts-trawl)).
