## Base Model Results

### Base Model Selection

Sources of structural uncertainty in this assessment remain largely the same as the previous assessment because this is an update rather than a benchmark assessment. Model selection processes were limited to fixing the two parameters related to selectivity and retention that were consistently estimated at their bounds during the bridging analysis (see Section \@ref(model-changes-from-the-last-assessment)).

In reality, un-modeled spatiotemporal variation in $M$, growth, and movement because of predation, availability of food resources, or environmental factors may, to an unknown degree, impact `r spp` and the perception of the stock size and status. Potential shifts in spatial distribution in response to changes in density outside the waters of the California Current or climate impacts could substantially reduce our ability to model and predict current and future trends. However, this degree of complexity is beyond the information content of the currently available data but efforts to synthesize existing data for Northeast Pacific `r spp` with the aim of stock-wide modeling are underway. Until then, residual patterns in the length data may be present due to un-modeled time-varying processes.

### Parameter Estimates

<!-- M, R_0, and growth -->
Estimates of key parameters include 
female $M$ =
`r text_parameter(model, "NatM_uniform_Fem_GP_1", "%.3f")` yr$^{-1}$, 
male $M$ =
`r text_parameter(model, "NatM_uniform_Mal_GP_1", "%.3f")` yr$^{-1}$, and
$R_0$ =
`r text_parameter(model, "SR_LN\\(R0\\)", "%.3f")` (Table \@ref(tab:parameters)). 
Females were estimated as growing larger than males with female length-at-age
`r inputs[["ctl"]][["Growth_Age_for_L2"]]`
(the second reference age) equal to 
`r text_parameter(model, "L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1", "%.1f")` cm compared to
`r text_parameter(model, "L_at_Amax_Mal_GP_1", "%.1f")` cm for males (Figure \@ref(fig:growth)) with each sex having relatively similar growth rates 
(`r text_parameter(model, "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1", "%.3f")` yr$^{-1}$ for females compared to
`r text_parameter(model, "VonBert_K_Mal_GP_1", "%.3f")` yr$^{-1}$ for males).

Age-based selectivity was estimated as dome shaped for all fishery and survey fleets in the model. <!-- Fleet 1 --> The model estimated sex-specific selectivity for the fixed-gear fleet with a higher selectivity on female fish compared to male `r spp`. The age of peak female selectivity for the for the fixed-gear fleet was fixed at
`r text_parameter(model, "Age.+peak_FIX.+\\)$", "%.0f")` for the historical period between `r startyr`--1996
but varied with time, decreasing in 1997 to
`r text_parameter(model, "Age.+peak_FIX.+1997$", "%.0f")`,
increasing in 2003 to
`r text_parameter(model, "Age.+peak_FIX.+2003$", "%.0f")`, and
decreasing in 2011 to
`r text_parameter(model, "Age.+peak_FIX.+2011$", "%.0f")`.
The peak of the fixed-gear female selectivity curve was the furthest to the right (selectivity peaking at older ages) of all the estimated curves in the model (Figure \@ref(fig:sel02-multiple-fleets-age1)), which is not surprising given that only 21 age-1 fish and zero age-0 fish have been aged from samples taken from this fleet. This assessment update added recent WCGOP data between 2020--2021 (discard rates, mean weights, and lengths) to better inform the final retention time period between 2019--`r endyr`. During model bridging the retention curve for the fixed-gear fleet estimated the peak size at the lower bound of 10 cm, a size where there is little to no selectivity, and it was decided to fix this parameter at the previous estimate of `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Retain_L_infl_FIX(1)_BLK2repl_2019", "Value"],1)`. The fixed-gear retention curve in the final time block, 2019-2022, estimated a decreased proportion (< 1.0) of retained fish across all sizes relative to the previous time block between 2011--2019 (Figures \@ref(fig:retention) - \@ref(fig:sel09-len-flt1sex2)). 

<!-- Fleet 2 -->
Selectivity for the trawl fleet was estimated as a single curve, rather than sex-specific, with four fixed parameters, one estimated time-invariant parameter, and one time-varying parameter. The width of the descending limb, which is time-varying, has been fixed for the early period since the 2019 model but this assessment also fixed the parameter at the upper bound of
`r text_parameter(model, "desc.+TWL.+2011$", "%.1f")`
in the terminal block because it was consistently estimated at the bound during the bridging analyses. The trawl fleet selects the largest range of `r spp` by age compared to all other fleets in the model. The initial age of peak selectivity for the for the trawl fleet was fixed at `r text_parameter(model, "Age.+peak_TWL.+\\)$", "%.0f")` across the time series with the model estimating changes in the descending limb of the selectivity curve to select a increasing proportion of older fish across time blocks: `r startyr`--1981, 1982--2002 , 2003--2010, and 2011--2022. The retention curve shifted rightward in the final time block (2019--2022), only retaining fish at larger sizes relative to the previous time block between 2011--2018 (Figures \@ref(fig:retention), \@ref(fig:sel09-len-flt2sex1), and \@ref(fig:sel09-len-flt2sex2)).

<!-- Fleet 3 Environmental Index -->
<!-- NA -->

<!-- Fleet 4 -->
The \gls{s-tri} was estimated to select the least amount of older fish, descending to a near-zero selectivity at about the same age, age 4--5, as the peak in the fixed-gear fleet (Figure \@ref(fig:sel02-multiple-fleets-age1)). Sex-specific selectivity was estimated for the \gls{s-tri}, with males selected at
`r model[["parameters"]] |> dplyr::filter(grepl("Age.+MaleatD.+_A", Label)) |> dplyr::mutate(Value = exp(Value) * 100) |> dplyr::pull(Value) |> sprintf(fmt = "%.0f")`
percent of females at age zero and
`r model[["parameters"]] |> dplyr::filter(grepl("Age.+MaleatM.+_A", Label)) |> dplyr::mutate(Value = exp(Value) * 100) |> dplyr::pull(Value) |> sprintf(fmt = "%.0f")`
percent of females at the maximum age (Figure \@ref(fig:sel02-multiple-fleets-age1)).
Although, female selectivity at approximately 5 years and older is small in its own right.

<!-- Fleet 5 -->
<!-- Fleet 6 -->
The time- and sex-invariant selectivities for the slope surveys are similar to their previous estimates, with the \gls{s-nslope} selecting more older fish than any other survey and the \gls{s-aslope} selecting fish at a younger age than the \gls{s-nslope} (Figure \@ref(fig:sel02-multiple-fleets-age1)). `r Spp` abundance is correlated with temperature and depth, and thus, the higher selectivities of the slope surveys may be a combination of availability and gear selectivity rather than just gear selectivity alone. The width of the descending limb for both slope surveys was poorly estimated, reflected in the high estimates of uncertainty for these parameters.

<!-- Fleet 7 -->
The \gls{s-wcgbt} was estimated to select fish at the youngest age (peak selectivity at age `r text_parameter(model, "Age.+_peak_NWCBO", "%.2f")`) and a similar amount of older fish as the \gls{s-aslope} (Figure \@ref(fig:sel02-multiple-fleets-age1)). The higher selection of young fish in the \gls{s-wcgbt} compared to the current fleets increases the potential for the \gls{s-wcgbt} to provide information about strong year classes sooner than the fisheries. 

<!-- A note about poor model configuration -->
A number of issues were noticed when reviewing the estimation of selectivity and retention in this assessment update. Across all fleets, there were a number of selectivity parameters that were estimated with high uncertainty that may indicate a lack of information in the data to estimate these parameters.  This assessment was also required to fixed several selectivity parameters that were estimated at parameter bounds. These general behaviors were also encountered in the 2019 assessment resulting in a number of selectivity parameters being fixed during model development due to poor estimation behavior at that time.  These issues in totality indicate that selectivity may be overparameterized.  The next benchmark assessments should explore simplifying selectivity as well as alternative parameterization. To better understand the impact of estimating poorly informed selectivity parameters, a sensitivity is included in Section \@ref(sensitivity-analyses) that fixes selectivity parameters with high uncertainty at their estimates but the model results are largely the same.

<!-- A note about poor model configuration 
Despite the small number of samples at young ages from this fleet, the model parameterization includes the estimation of the male offset at age zero. This parameter is noted in the \gls{ss3} manual [@methot_stock_2013] as being difficult to estimate and often poorly informed by the data. Best practices suggests that it should be fixed at zero, though fixing it at zero led to almost no differences in parameter estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:sensitivity-3-compare1-spawnbio)). At the peak, males were selected about
`r model[["parameters"]] |> dplyr::filter(grepl("Age.+MaleatD.+_FIX", Label)) |> dplyr::mutate(Value = exp(Value) * 100) |> dplyr::pull(Value) |> sprintf(fmt = "%2.0f")`
percent as much as females in this fishery.

<!-- Catchability -->
```{r q-estimates}
q_parameters <- text_parameter(model, "LnQ", "%.9f") |> as.numeric() |> exp()
q_text_range <- paste(round(range(q_parameters), 2), collapse = "--")
q_which_fleet_max <- recode_fleet_text(as.numeric(gsub(
  ".+\\(([0-9]+)\\)(.{0,})",
  "\\1",
  text_parameter(model, "LnQ", "%s", Label)
)[which.max(q_parameters)]))
q_4_blk <- exp(as.numeric(text_parameter(model, "LnQ.+4.+BLK", "%.2f")))
```
Estimates of catchability for the trawl surveys ranged from `r q_text_range` with the `r q_which_fleet_max` having the highest catchability across surveys. However, the catchability for this survey was estimated to have decreased in 1995 to `r round(q_4_blk,2)`. The input data for all historical surveys were not altered for this assessment and it could be that the estimates of abundance for the \gls{s-tri} are inflated relative to its footprint if the survey was projected to the entire California Current rather than just outside its spatial footprint. The environmental survey had the highest estimate of additional variance needed to fit the data of all the indices used in the model (Table \@ref(tab:parameters)). A sensitivity is included (see Section \@ref(sensitivity-analyses)) where the added variance for the \gls{s-wcgbt} was turned on, in which it was estimated to be non-zero, unlike in 2019 and 2021, which allowed to model to not fit the final two survey data points (2021 and 2022) that have sharply increased compared to the 2019 data point. 

<!-- recruitment -->
Estimated annual recruitment (Table \@ref(tab:parameters); Figure \@ref(fig:recruits)) was highest in the following ten years shown in descending order of the estimates:
`r model[["parameters"]] |> dplyr::filter(grepl("Dev", Label)) |> dplyr::arrange(-Value) |> dplyr::slice_head(n = 10) |> tidyr::separate_wider_delim(cols = Label, delim = "_", names = c("Period", "Type", "Year")) |> dplyr::pull(Year) |> glue::glue_collapse(", ", last = ", and ")`. The estimated recruitment deviations in 2020 and 2021 are the largest in the time series. These estimates are informed by the \gls{s-wcgbt} 2021-2022 data that had sharp increases in the number of age-0 and age-1 fish being observed.  Additionally, the fishery has reported encountering large numbers of small `r spp` in the last couple of years.  While there seems to be strong information that there may be multiple strong recruitments in recent years additional observations of these fish as they mature and enter the fishery will better inform the magnitude of these recruitments. The third largest estimated recruitment deviation in time series occurred in the mid-1960s. The exact year of this large recruitment is uncertain with the model estimating it to have occurred in a slightly different years with changes to the model parameterization (switching between 1964-1966).
The smallest ten recruitment events, which are harder to estimate than large events, occurred in the following years in ascending order:
`r model[["parameters"]] |> dplyr::filter(grepl("Dev", Label)) |> dplyr::arrange(Value) |> dplyr::slice_head(n = 10) |> tidyr::separate_wider_delim(cols = Label, delim = "_", names = c("Period", "Type", "Year")) |> dplyr::pull(Year) |> glue::glue_collapse(", ", last = ", and ")`. The bias adjustment ramp was left the same as the previous assessment except for extending the right limb by two years (Figure \@ref(fig:bias-adjust)). The suggested ramp is based on the environmental time series being informative about recruitment where we chose to retain the setting from previous assessments that implement the ramp with the onset of biological age samples rather than the start of the environmental time series. Recruitment is estimated based on the spawner-recruit curve in the forecast period but estimated up to the terminal year of data used to fit the model (Figure \@ref(fig:bh-curve)).


### Fits to the Data

**to do**: this section is incomplete

<!-- indices -->
The base model fit the trend (decline, then stabilization, and increase) in the \gls{s-wcgbt} well until the two most recent years of the survey (Figure \@ref(fig:index2-cpuefit-7)). The recent estimates were below the data providing some justification for estimating an additional variance parameter (see Section \@ref(sensitivity-analyses)). Fits to the \gls{s-nslope} were generally flat (Figure \@ref(fig:index2-cpuefit-6)), as might be expected for such short time series. Fits to the \gls{s-aslope} suggest a decreasing trend during the late 1990s followed by and increase into the early 2000s (Figure \@ref(fig:index2-cpuefit-5)). The \gls{s-tri} data also showed an increasing trend in the 2000s, though the model fails to fit the high estimates of abundance in the early 2000s and is even below the lower limit of the added variance (\@ref(fig:index2-cpuefit-4)).

Fits to the environmental time series were noisy, as they have been in previous assessments. The estimated index is essentially a flat line until the most recent years (Figure \@ref(fig:index2-cpuefit-3)). The estimated added standard deviation was `r text_parameter(model, "extra.+ENV", "%f")`, and thus, the sea-level index provided limited information regarding historical recruitment during model periods without other data. In 2019, this added variance parameter was estimated at 0.73 suggesting that the environmental index has lost some prediction power since the last benchmark assessment.

The model fit the trawl discard lengths less well than the discard lengths from the fixed-gear fleet (`r subset(information_fit_figures, partition == 1)[["label_text_group"]][[1]]`). The expected distribution of discarded lengths from the trawl fishery was shifted to the right of the observed lengths for the recent years, a pattern largely not seen in years prior to 2014. The previous assessment update had similar fits to the annual discard lengths for both fleets for the overlapping data years [2004--2019; @Kapur:2021:SSA].

### Population Trajectory

Spawning biomass, the proxy for spawning output, is estimated to have declined from an unfished equilibrium of
`r text_parameter(model, "S.+_Virgin", "%f", object = "derived_quants", big_mark = ",")` to
approximately 79,000 mt in the 1950s (Table \@ref(tab:timeseries) and Figure \@ref(fig:ts-spawning-biomass)). Biomass quickly turned around, increasing to unfished equilibrium by the mid-1970s, only to come right back down again to the management target in the early-2000s. Since then, two large recruitment events have led to sharp increases, though the biomass remains far from unfished levels (Figure \@ref(fig:ts-relative-spawning-biomass-forecast)). Total biomass largely follows the same trajectory, although estimates of recent spawning biomass are larger than estimates of spawning biomass in the 1970s (Figure \@ref(fig:ts-total-biomass)).
