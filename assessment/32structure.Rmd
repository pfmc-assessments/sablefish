## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Description of New Modeling Approaches

This section is not required for an update assessment.

### Modeling Platform and Structure

The assessment was conducted using \gls{ss3} version `r m_ss3_version` developed by Dr. Richard Methot at the \gls{noaa}, \gls{nwfsc} [@methot_stock_2013]. This most recent version was used because it included improvements and corrections not available in the previously used version of \gls{ss3}, i.e., version `r mp_ss3_version`.
Bridging between the previous and current base models is discussed in Section \@ref(model-changes-from-the-last-assessment). The R package [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss), version `r packageVersion("r4ss")`, was used to investigate and plot model fits.

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment

A brief list of changes that were made to the model configuration compared to the previous assessment [@Kapur:2021:SSA] are listed below.

- **Data**

  - The catch time series was both corrected and updated from the previous assessment. See Section \@ref(data) for more details on each of these changes.
    - First, catches from the Oregon Coast \gls{inpfc} area, i.e., between 42.000--46.267\textdegree N. are no longer excluded from the total catch.
    - Second, landings from 1977--1982 in the catch reporting area that includes both U.S. and Candadian waters are now assigned 50--50\% to each country rather than 100\% to the U.S.
    - Third, a time series of `r spp` catches from the At-Sea Pacific Hake fishery are now included in the trawl fleet. Previous assessments have included bycatch of `r spp` from the shoreside fleet but these at-sea catches were previously only included as a sensitivity. Note that the corresponding length-composition data from this bycatch fleet was not included.
  - The index for the \gls{s-wcgbt} was updated with the most recent data using _sdmtmb_.
  - The survey length-composition data were input as either sexed or unsexed fish rather than assigning a sex to unsexed fish based on the observed sex ratio as was done in the past.

- **Fleet structure**

  - Essentially, no changes were made to the fleet structure used in the model. Benign remenants of the pot fleet, which was removed in 2019, were removed from the model files.

- **Biology**

  - No changes were made to the biological parameterization of the model.

- **Recruitment**

  - The bias adjustment ramp was updated to end with the last year of catches and begin to ramp down towards zero two years prior. Other parameters in the ramp were left as they were specified in the 2019 assessment. Note that the traditional method for estimating these parameters, which occurrs external to the model, can often lead to the ramp starting years before composition data are available because of the inclusion of the environmental index.

- **Selectivity and retention**

  <!-- SizeSel_PRet_1_FIX(1)_BLK2repl_2019 -->
  - The ascending inflection for size-based retention within the fixed-gear fleet in the 2019 time block was fixed at the lower bound of 10 given that it was consistently estimated at this lower bound during the bridging analysis.
  <!-- AgeSel_P_4_TWL(2)_BLK5repl_2011 -->
  - The descending width for age-based selectivity within the trawl fleet in the 2011 time block was fixed at the upper bound of 10 given that it was consistently estimated at this upper bound during the bridging analysis.
  <!-- AgeSel_P_3_FIX(1)_BLK4repl_2011 INIT was lowered to facilitate its estimation. -->

- **Software and workflow**

  - Use a newer version of \gls{ss3}, version `r m_ss3_version`.
  - Use previously updated versions of numerous R packages related to processing input and output files for the assessment, including _nwfscDiag_, _sa4ss_, _r4ss_, and _PacFIN.Utilities_.
  - Created [_sablefish_](https::/github.com/pfmc-assessments/sablefish), an R package stored on GitHub, to provide a transparent and reproducible system for processing the data, modifying the model files, and writing these reports.
