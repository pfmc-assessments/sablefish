## Model Structure and Assumptions

### Description of New Modeling Approaches

This section is not required for an update assessment.

### Modeling Platform and Structure

The assessment was conducted using \gls{ss3} version `r m_ss3_version` developed by Dr. Richard Methot at the \gls{noaa}, \gls{nwfsc} [@methot_stock_2013]. This most recent version was used because it included improvements and corrections not available in the previously used version of \gls{ss3}, i.e., version `r mp_ss3_version`.
Bridging between the previous and current base models is discussed in Section \@ref(model-changes-from-the-last-assessment). The R package [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss), version `r packageVersion("r4ss")`, was used to investigate and plot model fits.

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment

A brief list of changes that were made to the model configuration compared to the previous assessment [@Kapur:2021:SSA] are listed below.

- **Data**

  - The catch time series was both corrected and updated from the previous assessment.
    First, catches from the Oregon Coast \gls{inpfc} area, i.e., between 42.000--46.267\textdegree~N are no longer excluded from the total catch.
    Second, landings from 1977--1982 in the catch reporting area that includes both U.S. and Candadian waters are now assigned 50--50\% to each country rather than 100\% to the U.S.
    Third, a time series of `r spp` catches from the At-Sea Pacific Hake fishery were included in the trawl fleet. Previous assessments have included bycatch of `r spp` from the shoreside fleet but these at-sea catches were previously excluded.
    See Section \@ref(data) for more details on each of these changes.

- **Fleet structure**

  - Benign remenants of the pot fleet, which was removed in 2019, were removed from the model files. This change did not change the model structure at all but rather just removed the non-existant fleet.

- **Biology**

  - No changes were made to the biological parameterization of the model.

- **Recruitment**

  - The bias adjustment ramp was updated to end with the last year of catches and begin to ramp down towards zero two years prior. Other parameters in the ramp were left as they were specified in the 2019 assessment.

- **Selectivity and retention**

  - 

- **Software and workflow**

  - Use a newer version of \gls{ss3}, version `r m_ss3_version`.
  - Use previously unavailable or updated versions of numerous R packages related to processing input and output files for the assessment, including _nwfscDiag_, _sa4ss_, _r4ss_, and _PacFIN.Utilities_.
  - Created [_sablefish_](https::/github.com/pfmc-assessments/sablefish), an R package stored on GitHub, to provide a transparent and reproducible system for processing the data, modifying the model files, and writing these reports.
