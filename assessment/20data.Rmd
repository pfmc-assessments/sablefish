# Data

<!--
Data comprise the foundational components of stock assessment models.
The decision to include or exclude particular data sources in an assessment model depends on many factors.
These factors often include, but are not limited to,
the way in which data were collected (e.g., measurement method and consistency);
the spatial and temporal coverage of the data;
the quantity of data available per desired sampling unit;
the representativeness of the data to inform the modeled processes of importance;
timing of when the data were provided;
limitations imposed by the Terms of Reference; and
the presence of an avenue for the inclusion of the data in the assessment model.
Attributes associated with a data source can change through time,
as can the applicability of the data source when different modeling approaches are explored (e.g., stock structure or time-varying processes).
Therefore, the specific data sources included or excluded from this assessment should not necessarily constrain the selection of data sources applicable to future stock assessments for `r spp`.
Even if a data source is not directly used in the stock assessment they can provide valuable insights into biology, fishery behavior, or localized dynamics.

Data from a wide range of programs were available for possible inclusion in the current assessment model.
Descriptions of each data source included in the model (Figure \@ref(fig:data-plot)) and sources that were explored but not included in the base model are provided below.
Data that were excluded from the base model were explicitly explored during the development of this stock assessment or have not changed since their past exploration in a previous `r spp` stock assessment.
In some cases, the inclusion of excluded data sources were explored through sensitivity analyses (see Section \@ref(assessment-model)).

All data incorporated within this assessment are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:data-summary). This assessment update for `r spp` followed a more limited data updating approach compared to typical update assessments.  An assessment update for `r spp` was added to the 2023 assessment workload in [April 23, 2023](https://www.pcouncil.org/april-2023-decision-summary-document/) with the agreement that the assessment adhere to a more limited approach to updating data compared to a typical assessment update. The following data sources were updated for this assessment update:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The work to add recent commercial to the model for 2021--2022 identified two issues in the landings data in the 2021 assessment update which likely extended to previous assessments. Select landings Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) for sablefish were omitted for the 2019 benchmark and 2021 update assessments. These landings have been added to this update assessment (see section \ref{commercial-landings} for additional information) Additionally, it appears that previous assessments failed to include bycatch from the at-sea fishery. The annual bycatch of sablefish by the at-sea fishery of sablefish is typically relatively low but after there have been sharp increases following years of large recruitment events (e.g., 304 mt in 2022).
  \item The discard rates, mean weights and length compositions from discarded fish observed by the \gls{wcgop} were updated and the new values for 2020 and 2021 were added to the model.  
  \item The relative index of abundance, length composition, and conditional-age-at-length data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} were updated and extended through 2022.
  \item The environmental index to inform estimation of recruitment were updated and extended through 2022.
\end{enumerate}

All other data sources used in the `r spp` assessment were retained in the same form as included in the 2021 assessment update.
